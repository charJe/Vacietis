Vacietis aims to be a C99 to Common Lisp compiler that produces
efficient programs that easily interoperate with Lisp functions, and
in addition to offer the introspection, debugging and type-safety
features of Common Lisp to C programmers.

The initial Vacietis code base is an import of the Zeta-C C to
Zetalisp compiler public domain sources released by Zeta-C's author,
Scott Burson. The original public domain Zeta-C sources are available
at http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/TI/Explorer/zeta-c/

However, Vacietis is licensed under the LLGPL (see the file LICENSE
included with the distribution for details). This covers the public
domain source code originally imported from Zeta-C - any changes to
Vacietis must likewise be released under the terms of the LLGPL. For
the purposes of assigning copyright, the Vacietis project has been
copyrighted by its originator, Vladimir Sedach
<vsedach@gmail.com>. Contributors can choose to keep or assign
copyright on their contributions.

Currently, the project doesn't compile on Common Lisp. A conservative
estimate is that most of the Zeta-C code will need to be replaced,
however the goal is to re-use as much as possible. When Vacietis
starts working, we'll make an announcement and remove this
notice. That might take a while, so don't expect to find Vacietis in
Quicklisp anytime soon!
