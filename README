Vacietis is a C to Common Lisp compiler inspired by the Zeta-C
compiler for Lisp Machines
(http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/TI/Explorer/zeta-c/) and TCC
(http://bellard.org/tcc/).

The goal of Vacietis is to enable loading and running C code in a
Common Lisp application. To this effect Vacietis uses the host CL
calling convention for C functions and the CL package system for
function and variable names, in essence treating the host CL runtime
as a virtual machine.

* TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  -----------------

Vacietis uses the memory model of Common Lisp as is, so sizeof of the
primitive data types (char, int, float etc.) is all 1. This shouldn't
be a problem for most C code, but some C programs claim to be portable
while making assumptions that things can be cast into an array of
chars to be manipulated. These programs won't work under Vacietis.


* OBTAINING CODE AND HELP:
  -----------------------

The official Vacietis repository is at:
https://github.com/vsedach/vacietis

There is a Vacietis mailing list on the web:
http://groups.google.com/group/vacietis

Bug reports can be sent to the mailing list
(http://groups.google.com/group/vacietis), the github issue tracker
(https://github.com/vsedach/vacietis), or directly to the author
(vsedach@gmail.com)


* TODO:
  ----
- struct accessors
- enums
- function pointers
- libc stdio: scanf, binary streams
- libc stddef: offsetof
- libc signal
- libc stdlib: div/ldiv, srand, exit cleanup
- libc time
- libc setjmp


* THINGS THAT PROBABLY WON'T BE SUPPORTED:
  ---------------------------------------
- trying to cast arrays of chars to other types (mmap)
- any kind of GCC extension
